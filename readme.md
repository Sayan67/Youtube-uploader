## What is UTuberrr. ?

It is a platform for Youtubers to make their life easy.
But How?
-Suppose you're an Youtuber and you're having a huge number of audience. But for content creation you lead a very busy schedule. It is next to impossible for you to edit your own videos and post it using proper Title, Description, Tags etc on Youtube. So you hire a person to edit your videos and upload it in your youtube channel. But for that you need to give the access of your channel to that person. 
But isn't it too much risky??
Yes of course!! He can do whatever he wants to do with your channel.
## Here comes our platform UTuberrr.
Basically we provide a platform where you(Youtuber) and your service provider(Editor) where both can login. We(our server) will have the access of your Youtube channel(Which is safe by legal bounds). Now you do not need to give the access of your channel to your service provider(editor).
He can directly upload the video in your Youtube channel using Title, Tags, Description etc. through our website.
Our server will upload the video in your channel using YoutubeAPI.
So it's Safe!

## Challenges üõ†Ô∏è
Creating this website was not really easy for us.We faced quite a few complications in the process some of which are:

1. Creating a seameless responsive website that meets all the objectives was a rigourous job.
2. Using Google's OAuth2.0 for the feature #sign in with google was a hectic task for us. Generating client id, client secrets and keeping track of them and binding the code blocks in proper place was a no     doubt tough job for us.
3. Connecting YoutubeAPIv3 and managing this complex backend¬†server was the most difficult part though.

## Upcoming Modifications to be added:
- [x] 1. We will properly integrate YoutubeAPI using token recieved through Google OAuth2.0. 
- [ ] 2. We have planned for another layer for protection and security to our consumers(Youtuber). In due time,we are going to modify our platform in such a way such that the consumer get a option to approve         the upload after the service provider(Video editor) uploads the video to our website. The consumer gets a pop up in his/her dashboard, where he/she can see the Video, Title, Description, Tags and            make sure it is the desired video and infos are correct. Only then the video gets uploaded from our server.
- [ ] 3. Improve UI and UX
- [ ] 4. Different UI for Clients and freelancer

## How to Contribute

- Take a look at the Existing [Issues] or create your own!
- Fork the Repo and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working upon.
- Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.
- Add Screenshots to help us know what this is all about.

## How to make a Pull Request

**1.** Fork the repository by clicking on the Fork symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```
   git clone https://github.com/<Your name>/Youtube-uploader.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```
   cd Youtube-uploader
```

**4.** Create a new branch:

```
   git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**5.** Make changes in source code.

**6.** Stage your changes and commit

```
   git add .
   git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repo.

```
   git push origin YourBranchName
```

**8.** Create a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

**Note** If anyone contributes to this repository, then the changes will not be reflected in your local repository. For that:

**9.** Setup a reference(remote) to the original repository to get all the changes from the remote.

```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<Your name>/Youtube-uploader.git
```

**10.** Check the remotes for this repository.

```
   git remote -v
```

**11.** Fetching from the remote repository will bring in its branches and their respective commits.

```
   git fetch upstream
```

**12.** Make sure that you're on your master branch.

```
   git checkout master
```

**13.** Now that we have fetched the upstream repository, we want to merge its changes into our local branch. This will bring that branch into sync with the upstream, without losing our local changes.

```
   git merge upstream/master
```

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocking you from working further.
