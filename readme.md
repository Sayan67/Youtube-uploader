## About us üíú

We are a platform that ensures security and facilitates access to one's YouTube channel that involves combining authentication, authorization, and management features to provide a secure and user-friendly experience for channel owners.

## Features üñ•Ô∏è
1. We enable channel owners to upload, schedule, and manage video content directly from the platform.            
2. Your channel credentials remain passport protected with us.The merchants don't get the access to those.  
3. The merchant consumers choose,edits the video,sets the thumbnail,etc as per their words and uploads the video from their channel.


## Use ‚öôÔ∏è
Consumers dont need to invest themselves in uploading content,securing the internet,etc.Their merchants do it seemlessly for them that too without knowing their channel credentials!We provide you with that platform.

## Overview üìñ
We are a platform that empowers YouTube channel owners with robust security measures and convenient access management tools. Whether you're a solo content creator or manage a team of collaborators, we provide a seamless and secure environment for managing your YouTube channel effectively.

## Challenges üõ†Ô∏è
Creating this website was not really easy for us.We face quite a few complications in the process some of which are:

1. Creating a responsive and working website that met all the objectives was a rigourous job.
2. Using OAuth2.0 was quiet a task for us.
3. Connecting YoutubeAPI and managing this complex backend¬†server was the most difficult part though.

## Upcoming Modifications
We have planned a layout for providing another layer of security to our consumers.In due time,we are going to modify our platform in such a way such that the consumer gets am email from us just before uploading of the contents.Via this mail,the consumer gets to see the thumbnail set,the caption provided ,video contents,etc, provided by the merchant.Only if the consumer confirms to the changes made,the content gets uploaded on to his/her channel.If the consumer denies ,then no upload occurs.
